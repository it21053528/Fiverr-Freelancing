1. Need to find which is the most accurate method to forecast demand.
2. 3 years data set is going to be provided (If needed, you can generate it back to more years and can use. But should stick to that data set)
3. Should use Python with ML
4. Use trained models as much as possible
5. Need to forecast demand using 
   1. Simple Moving Average (SMA)
   2. Exponential Smoothing (SES)
   3. Autoregressive Integration Moving Average (ARIMA)
   4. Neural Network (NN)
   5. Croston 
these 5 methods. 
6. Then should find the most accurate one.
7. Clearly show the method of evaluation and the method of calculating the accuracy.
8.  Use Google Colab for coding
9. All the coding and all related work needed
10. Make a small interface to display demand forecasting using the most accurate method. (Use Flask)
11. Need to add all the comments clearly
12. One week of work
