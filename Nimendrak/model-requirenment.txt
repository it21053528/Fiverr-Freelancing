The objective is to predict the most suitable optimizer under available resources such as cpu, mem. the dataset is looks like this;

optimizer,cpu,memory,time,epochs,predictions,dataset,loss,accuracy

optimizer - optimizer that can be used for the model training [sgd, adam, adamax]
cpu - cpu consumption for each epoch [calculated as a average percentage]
memory - memory consumption for each epoch [calculated as a average percentage]
time - time to execute each epoch [difference between epoch end and begin time]
epochs - no of epochs [no of epochs till it meet earlystopping point, this can be different by the 
predictions - prediction results that has been done using the trained model [contains out of 16 test cases]
optimizer because the they have unique behavior]
size - datasize size in MB
loss and accuracy - final model loss and accuracy

Modelling.zip contains the work that I have done so far.
